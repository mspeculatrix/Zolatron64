### CPLD code

This folder is for CUPL code for CPLDs used on the Zolatron 64 platform.

I'm using the ATF150xASL family of CPLD chips. But I'm still learning.

EXTMEMDECODE is for the Extended Memory board.

You can read about my initial (yet oddly successful) attempts at coding CPLDs here: https://mansfield-devine.com/speculatrix/2022/06/a-newbies-introduction-to-cupl-and-cplds/
