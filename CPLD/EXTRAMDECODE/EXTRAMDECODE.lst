 12:
 13:This provides decoding for extended memory on the Zolatron 64.
 14:
 15:The memory sits at address $8000. The decoding allows us to select one of 16
 16:8K banks at this address.
 17:
 18:The bank is selected by writing the value 0-15 to the address $BFE0. This
 19:CPLD provides the decoding for that address as well as a register (BSEL) of four
 20:D-type latches that hold the selected value.
 21:
 22:This register connects to address lines A13-A16 of the RAM, thus
 23:selecting the effective address of the bank.
 24:
 25:The BSEL register is also used to select among five chip enable signals -
 26:four for the RAM chips and one for the RAM. If the BSEL value is 0-3
 27:then the appropriate CHIP_EN line 0-3 is selected. If BSEL is 4-15 then
 28:CHIP_EN4 is selected.
 29:
 30:On the board itself, four jumpers individually select whether CHIP_EN lines
 31:0-3 go to their respective ROMs or to the RAM.

 54:/* The four D-latches in the BSEL register have their clocks enabled (allowing
 55:the flip-flop to be set to the appropriate value) only when the main clock is
 56:high *and* BSEL_EN is active.
 57:
 58:Essentially if you write to $BFE0, BSEL_EN gets enabled when the clock goes
 59:high. The four latches will set according to the inputs on D0-D3.
 60:When the clock goes low, these values are latched. When we no longer have $BFE0
 61:as the address, the values will remain latched.
 62:
 63:These four latches are connected to A13-A16 on the RAM chip. They're
 64:not attached to the address bus - so they don't interfere with anything else.
