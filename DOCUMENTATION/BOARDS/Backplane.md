# BACKPLANE

Although the backplane itself is a relatively simple critter, it also involved some of the hardest decision-making.

There was the question over what kind of connector. Some people use simple header pins for this sort of thing, which are cheap and easy to implement. But they didn't seem sufficiently serious (or robust). IDE-style edge connectors were another way to go, but can add cost to PCBs.

In the end I settled on DIN 41612 64P AC connectors. These use two rows of 32 pins each. (The connectors in the picture above have three rows, but the middle one is unused.)

These connectors are very stable and quite tolerant of frequent plugging/unplugging. And I figured 64 pins should be enough. (Spoiler alert: I was right.)

The big decision

But that wasn't the big decision. That came next.

Which signals do I connect to which pins? Yikes!

I looked at a whole bunch of small system buses and agonised over what signals I needed to include and where. With the address bus, for example, do I run all 16 signals in a continous row or have eight in one column and the other eight alongside in the other column?

In the end, much came down to guesswork. After all, I hadn't built the damn machine yet. I wasn't even sure which signals I needed. So I fudged. I borrowed a few signal names from other computers which I ultimately didn't use (I'm looking at you /BUSACK and /BUSREQ) and others I forgot to implement on the appropriate cards (TX and RX, doh!).

The full list of signals not currently used is: VPB, RDY, SYNC, BE (these are all 6502 signals that might be wanted in future projects), RAMSEL (no idea what I was thinking there), /BUSREQ, /BUSACK, TX and RX. Also, the USR0-USR7 signals are intended for decoding peripherals in some clever way I haven't invented yet â€“ but I do have a slight inkling of how I might use those.

There are VCC and GND connections at both top and bottom, with GND lines also bracketing the PHI2 clock signal, because that felt like a good idea. There are also ground connections in the centre. Can't have too many grounds. In fact, I probably should have had more.

Having clock-qualified read enable (/RD_EN) and write enable (/WR_EN) signals for distribution to all boards turned out to be a good choice.

And yes, the address and data signals are in a line, mostly because I couldn't make a case for not doing that.

The bus as viewed on the backplane. Due to right-angle connections, the columns are swapped on the plug-in cards.

No termination

One thing you won't find on the backplane are termination resistors. The signal traces on the board are about 160mm long and this is a 1MHz system, so I figured transmission line echoes were unlikely to cause me grief.

All signals are broken out to pins at the edges of the board.

Apart from that, I added power input (not regulated, so a clean +5V input is required), a power LED, some capacitors for good measure (this is a four-layer board, so it also has ground and power planes), and two four-pin rows of header pins connected to ground to use when probing with a multimeter or oscilloscope (something I also add to all the plug-in boards).
